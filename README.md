# Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts

This project was created for the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path. It was created to a given design spec, however I modified the stylesheet to practice styling beyond the scope of the assignment. I am always looking for feedback, and appreciate any code review suggestions.
